	Abstract = {Zyxin is a component of adhesion plaques that has been suggested to perform regulatory functions at these specialized regions of the plasma membrane. Here we describe the isolation and characterization of cDNAs encoding human and mouse zyxin. Both the human and mouse zyxin proteins display a collection of proline-rich sequences as well as three copies of the LIM domain, a zinc finger domain found in many signaling molecules. The human zyxin protein is closely related in sequence to proteins implicated in benign tumorigenesis and steroid receptor binding. Antibodies raised against human zyxin recognize an 84-kDa protein by Western immunoblot analysis. The protein is localized at focal contacts in adherent erythroleukemia cells. By Northern analysis, we show that zyxin is widely expressed in human tissues. The zyxin gene maps to human chromosome 7q32-q36.},

	Abstract = { Zyxin is a dual-function LIM domain protein that regulates actin dynamics in response to mechanical stress and shuttles between focal adhesions and the cell nucleus. Here we show that zyxin contributes to UV-induced apoptosis. Exposure of wild-type fibroblasts to UV-C irradiation results in apoptotic cell death, whereas cells harboring a homozygous disruption of the zyxin gene display a statistically significant survival advantage. To gain insight into the molecular mechanism by which zyxin promotes apoptotic signaling, we expressed an affinity-tagged zyxin variant in zyxin-null cells and isolated zyxin-associated proteins from cell lysates under physiological conditions. A 130-kDa protein that was co-isolated with zyxin was identified by microsequence analysis as the Cell Cycle and Apoptosis Regulator Protein-1 (CARP-1). CARP-1 associates with the LIM region of zyxin. Zyxin lacking the CARP-1 binding region shows reduced proapoptotic activity in response to UV-C irradiation. We demonstrate that CARP-1 is a nuclear protein. Zyxin is modified by phosphorylation in cells exposed to UV-C irradiation, and nuclear accumulation of zyxin is induced by UV-C exposure. These findings highlight a novel mechanism for modulating the apoptotic response to UV irradiation. },

@article{Crawford25031991,
	Abstract = {We describe here the purification and characterization of a recently identified adherens junction protein that has an apparent molecular mass of 82 kDa on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels (Beckerle, M. C. (1986) J. Cell Biol. 103, 1679-1687). The 82-kDa protein was isolated from avian smooth muscle by a low ionic strength alkaline pH extraction followed by ammonium sulfate fractionation. Sequential chromatographic separation using DEAE-cellulose, phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B, and hydroxylapatite resins results in a purified 82-kDa protein. The 82-kDa protein has a Stokes radius of 5.6 nm and a relative sedimentation coefficient of 3.0 S. The calculated native molecular mass of the protein based on its hydrodynamic properties is 69 kDa, and the derived frictional ratio (f/fo) is 2.1. The protein does not focus discretely by isoelectric-focusing-sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; there are numerous isoelectric point variants in the range of 6.4-7.2, with the average isoelectric point being 6.9. The 82-kDa protein is phosphorylated in vivo and appears to be a cytoplasmic component of adherens junctions. The properties of the 82-kDa protein distinguish it from other known adherens junction proteins of this molecular mass. In fibroblasts, the 82-kDa protein is found in adhesion plaques as well as along actin-containing stress fibers near where they terminate at sites of cell-substratum adhesion. It is also found in the cell-cell adherens junctions of pigmented retinal epithelial cells and the dense plaques of smooth muscle cells. Since the 82-kDa protein is found at both cell-substratum and cell-cell adherens junctions, we propose to call it zyxin, meaning a joining, to indicate that it is found at regions where extracellular ligands are structurally and functionally joined to the cytoskeleton.},

@article{SCHNITTGER199350,
	Abstract = {The cystatin C gene (CST3) encodes a low-molecular-weight cysteine proteinase inhibitor belonging to family II of the cystatin super family and is mutated in cases of hereditary cystatin C amyloid angiopathy (HCCAA). CST3, which along with other family II cystatin genes is a member of the cystatin gene family, has been assigned to chromosome 20. To investigate the genomic organization on chromosome 20, the CST3 gene and related sequences were regionally mapped by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), Southern blot, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis using the cDNA cystatin C probe C6a and three genomic probes, C3E1, C3E2, and C3E2-2. Probe C3E2-2, which like probe C3E2 is specific for CST3, hybridized to only one Hind III and one XbaI fragment on Southern blots and to a 300-kb Bss HII PFGE fragment. FISH with probe C3E2 mapped this locus to chromosome 20p11.2, with an FL-pter value of 0.37 $\pm$ 0.07 on the physical map. Probe C3E1 containing the most conserved cystatin gene exon (exon 1) and its flanking sequences hybridized with more fragments, e.g., to eight Xba I and nine HindIII fragments on conventional Southern blots and to eight SmaI, two BssHII (900 and 300 kb), and two Not I fragments after PFGE. FISH with C3E1 revealed only one single site at 20p11.2 with an FL-pter value of 0.37 $\pm$ 0.04, identical to that obtained with C3E2. From these results it is concluded that (1) exon 1 and its flanking sequences are preferentially conserved within the cystatin gene family and that (2) CST3 and probably seven other members of the cystatin gene family are clustered within an at maximum 1.2-Mb segment on chromosome 20p11.2.},
